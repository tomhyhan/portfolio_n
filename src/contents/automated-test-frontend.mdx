This post is the second part of the series about understanding automated testing. In the previous post, we learned the `basics` of how to write a unit test for a calculator project. We also introduced `mocks` and `stubs` to effectively isolate the unit test environment.

In this post, we will explore a common style for organizing a unit test. Afterward, we will proceed to write both unit and integration tests for a React project. Finally, we will cover writing an E2E test.

# GivenWhenThen Testing Style

`GivenWhenThen` is a common style for structurally organizing a unit test. The idea is to seperate the test into three sections:

First, the `Given` section is where we set up the "precondition" to test environment. For example, if we are testing a React component with props, we could set up the props for testing purposes.  

Second, the  `When` section is where we execute the test. For example, we could render the component we just set up in the `Given` section.

Fianlly, the  `Then` section is where we check whether the result of the test is what we expected. For example, we could check if the component has been rendered as expected.

# Unit && Integration Test - React

The sepration between `unit` and `integration` test is blur. Indeed, teams may have different definitions for these two terms. 

In this post, we will define `unit` test as testing a single component. `integration` test as testing a specific url `route`.

## `Set` up

For this post, I have created a Vite project with React. 

## `Component` test

## `Integration` test

# E2E Test
