Testing is an essential part of the development life cycle. It ensures that our application works as expected, giving us the confidence to build and improve our software without worrying about breaking existing features.

In fact, we conduct tests all the time during development. For example, let's consider building a UI for our application. How do you ensure if the UI is functioning as expected? You open the browser and check whether the button is positioned correctly, if the color is right, if the text is accurate, and so on.

Initially, manual testing is a good starting point. However, as our application grows, it becomes impractical to test it manually every time we make changes. This is where automated testing comes in.

Automated tests allow us to automate manual testing processes, eliminating the need to test our application manually with every change. Well-written automated tests can save us a significant amount of time and effort in the long run.

In this series, we are going to dive into creating automated tests in several different steps:

    1. basic test
    2. Frontend test
    3. Backend test

# Testing Principles && Guidelines

To write good tests, it is essential to keep in mind the following principles and guidelines. This approach allows us to focus on writing tests that matter and avoid creating tests that are not useful.

`First` Principles:

Fast - Projects can include hundreds, if not thousands, of unit tests. Tests should be fast and reduce dependencies on slow factors, such as querying databases or network connections.

Isolated - Unit tests are truly isolated from one another. If one test fails, we know exactly where to fix it.

Repeatable: Tests should not be flaky. Every time we run the test, it should yield the same result.

Self-Checking: We should not check the test result manually. The test should automatically inform us if it passes or fails (e.g., using assert).

Timely: Tests should be written at the right time. They should not be written after deployment, nor should they take more time to write than the actual code.

`RIGHT BICEP` guidelines (testing areas):

Right - are the test results right?
B - are all the boundary conditions CORRECT? Check the edge cases. Check the range of values (null, overflow, underflow, special characters ... ).
I - can you check inverse relationships? If you add 1, can you subtract 1 to get back to where you started?
C - can you cross-check results using other means?
E - can you force error conditions to happen?
P - are performance characteristics within bounds?

# Tools

For this post, we are going to use `Jest`, which includes both a test runner and an assertion library. It is a popular JavaScript test framework that is easy to use and has rich features.

# Basic Test

To start, we are going to create a reversed polish notation calculator to familiarize ourselves with Jest features.

## Creata a project with jest

```bash
mkdir caculator
cd caculator
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev jest
```

## Create arithmatic functions

Let's start with basic arithmetic operations. Then, we will use `Jest Matchers` to validate the results.

create a file `utils.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

function sub(x, y) {
  return x - y;
}

function mul(x, y) {
  return x * y;
}

function div(x, y) {
  if (y == 0) {
    throw new Error('Can not divide by 0');
  }
  return x / y;
}

module.exports = { add, sub, div, mul };
```

We have four functions: add, sub, mul, div. It's important to note that the div function throws an error if we attempt to divide by 0.

## Test the utility functions

Next, create a `test` folder and inside, create a file `utils.test.js`.

```javascript
const { add, mul, sub, div } = require('../utils');

describe('utility functions for creating calculator', () => {
  test('3 + 5 is 8', () => {
    expect(add(3, 5)).toBe(8);
  });

  test('3 - 5 is -2', () => {
    expect(sub(3, 5)).toBe(-2);
  });

  test('3 * 5 is 15', () => {
    expect(mul(3, 5)).toBe(15);
  });

  test('3 / 5 is 0.6', () => {
    expect(div(3, 5)).toBeCloseTo(0.6);
  });

  test('3 / 0 to thorw an error', () => {
    expect(() => {
      div(3, 0);
    }).toThrow('Can not divide by 0');
  });
});
```

In the above code, we first import all the utility functions from utils.js. The describe function creates a test suite that gathers all related tests. We use the test method to individually test each function

Tests should be straightforward, but there are two exceptions. First, when dealing with floating-point numbers, we should use `toBeCloseTo` instead of `toBe` to avoid rounding errors. Second, when testing if div throws an error, we should use a `callback` function inside `expect`."

## Run the test

In the command line, run `npm run test -- --testPathPattern=./test/utils.test.js` and we should see the following output:

```bash
utility functions for creating calculator
    √ 3 + 5 is 8 (2 ms)
    √ 3 - 5 is -2
    √ 3 * 5 is 15
    √ 3 / 5 is 0.6
    √ 3 / 0 to thorw an error (9 ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       5 passed, 5 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        0.511 s, estimated 1 s
```

## Creating calculator

Now, let's create a simple calculator using the utility functions we just created.

Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is a different way of representing arithmetic operations. Instead of writing '1 + 2 _ 3', we write '1 2 3 _ +'. The advantage is that we don't need to worry about the order of operations and parentheses. We can simply read from left to right. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) for more detail.

Create a file `calc.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
const { add, sub, div, mul } = require('./utils.js');

const MATH_OPERATIONS = {
  '+': add,
  '-': sub,
  '*': mul,
  '/': div,
};

function tokenize(expression) {
  if (!/^[0-9+\-*/\s()]+$/.test(expression)) {
    throw new Error('not a valid expression');
  }

  const split_expression = expression.split(' ');
  const stack = [];
  const tokens = [];
  for (const token of split_expression) {
    if (!isNaN(token)) {
      tokens.push(token);
    } else {
      switch (token) {
        case '+':
        case '-':
          while (
            stack.length != 0 &&
            ['*', '%'].includes(stack[stack.length - 1])
          ) {
            const take_presidence = stack.pop();
            tokens.push(take_presidence);
          }
          stack.push(token);
          break;
        case '*':
        case '/':
        case '(':
          stack.push(token);
          break;
        case ')':
          let current = stack.pop();
          while (stack.length != 0 && current != '(') {
            tokens.push(current);
            current = stack.pop();
          }
          break;
        default:
          throw new Error('not a valid token!');
      }
    }
  }
  while (stack.length != 0) {
    tokens.push(stack.pop());
  }
  return tokens;
}

function evaluate(tokens) {
  const stack = [];
  for (const token of tokens) {
    if (!isNaN(token)) {
      stack.push(token);
    } else {
      const y = parseInt(stack.pop());
      const x = parseInt(stack.pop());
      const result = MATH_OPERATIONS[token](x, y);
      stack.push(result);
    }
  }
  return stack[0];
}

function calculator(expression) {
  const tokens = tokenize(expression);
  return evaluate(tokens);
}

module.exports = { calculator, evaluate, tokenize };
```

We start by importing the arithmetic functions. Then, the above code can be explained as follows:

    1. MATH_OPERATIONS: An object that maps the operator to the corresponding function.
    2. tokenize: Converts the expression into a 'reverse Polish notation' tokens, for example, '1 + 2 * 3' => ['1', '2', '3', '*', '+']. The expression only contains numbers, operators, parentheses, and spaces. Also, there must be a space between each token.
    3. evaluate: Performs arithmetic operations on the tokens and returns the result.
    4. calculator: A function that takes an expression as a parameter and returns the result.

## Test the calculator

Next, create a file `calc.test.js` inside test folder. Since there are three functions in `calc.js`, we are going to create three test blocks.

```javascript
const { calculator, evaluate, tokenize } = require('../calc');

describe('tokenize', () => {
  test('throw error if expression is invalid', () => {
    expect(() => {
      tokenize('1 + 2 & 5 ');
    }).toThrow('not a valid expression');
  });

  test('throw error if no space between expression tokens', () => {
    expect(() => {
      tokenize('(1 + 2) * 5 ');
    }).toThrow('not a valid token!');
  });

  test("1 + 2 * 5 correctly tokenize to ['1','2','5','*','+']", () => {
    expect(tokenize('1 + 2 * 5')).toStrictEqual(['1', '2', '5', '*', '+']);
  });
});
```

First, we import the necessary functions and create a test block for the tokenize function. The first test checks if the expression (our parameter) contains any characters other than numbers, operators, parentheses, and spaces. The second test verifies if there is a space between expression tokens. The third test ensures that the expression is correctly converted into tokens

```javascript
describe('evaluate', () => {
  test("['1','2','5','*','+'] evaluated to 11", () => {
    expect(evaluate(['1', '2', '5', '*', '+'])).toBe(11);
  });
});
```

The `evaludate` test block checks if the tokens are correctly evaluated to the result.

```javascript
describe('calculator', () => {
  test('( 1 + 2 ) * ( 3 * ( 4 + 5 ) ) calculates to 81', () => {
    expect(calculator('( 1 + 2 ) * ( 3 * ( 4 + 5 ) )')).toBe(81);
  });
});
```

Lastly, the `calculator` function test block checks if the expression is correctly calculated to the result.

## Run the test

Run `npm run test -- --testPathPattern=./test/calc` and we should see the following output:

```bash
PASS  calculator/test/calc.test.js
    tokenize
    √ throw error if expression is invalid (11 ms)
    √ throw error if no space between expression tokens (4 ms)
    √ 1 + 2 * 5 correctly tokenize to ['1','2','5','*','+'] (1 ms)
    evaluate
    √ ['1','2','5','*','+'] evaluated to 11
    calculator
    √ ( 1 + 2 ) * ( 3 * ( 4 + 5 ) ) calculates to 81

Tests:       5 passed, 5 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        0.734 s, estimated 1 s
```

# Dependency test in Jest

With the calculator project, we have familiarized ourselves with `Matchers` in `Jest`. Now, let's create another project to learn how we can isolate our tests by separating the dependencies.

## Mock

In `Jest`, mock functions can be used in place of the actual functions or modules. It allows us to test the code in isolation without worrying about the implementation details of the dependencies.

## Creating Music Service

This time, we are going to create a Music service that fetches the music data from the server. Create a `mock` folder and inside, create files `MusicService.js` and `MusicClient.js`

```javascript
class MusicClient {
  async get() {
    const data = await fetch('https://music/myfavorite');
    return await data.json();
  }
}
module.exports = MusicClient;
```

```javascript
class MusicClient {
  async get() {
    const data = await fetch('https://music/myfavorite');
    return await data.json();
  }
}
module.exports = MusicClient;
```

The `MusicClient` class make a request to a fake server and returns favorite music data.

```javascript
class MusicService {
  constructor(client) {
    this.client = client;
    this.favoriteMusic = null;
  }

  async getFavoriteMusic() {
    if (this.favoriteMusic === null) {
      this.favoriteMusic = await this.client.get();
    }
  }
}

module.exports = MusicService;
```

The `MusicService` class takes a `MusicClient` as a dependency and fetches favorite music data from the server. The getFavoriteMusic method fetches the data once and caches it. Subsequent calls to the method will return the cached data instead of making a request to the server.

Note that we have separated the API request and the business logic so that we can test the business logic without worrying about the API request.

## Implementing the test with Mock

Now, create a `test` folder inside the `mock` folder and create a file `MusicService.test.js`.

```javascript
const MusicClient = require('../MusicClient');
const MusicService = require('../MusicService');

jest.mock('../MusicClient.js');

describe('MusicService', () => {
  const get = jest.fn(() => ['song1', 'song2']);
  MusicClient.mockImplementation(() => ({
    get,
  }));
  let musicService;
  beforeEach(() => {
    musicService = new MusicService(new MusicClient());
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    get.mockClear();
    MusicClient.mockClear();
  });

  test('fetching favorite music', async () => {
    await musicService.getFavoriteMusic();

    expect(musicService.favoriteMusic).toStrictEqual(['song1', 'song2']);
  });

  test('calls get() only once after caching favorite music', async () => {
    await musicService.getFavoriteMusic();
    await musicService.getFavoriteMusic();

    expect(get).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
  });
});
```

In the test above, we:

    1. Import the `MusicClient` and `MusicService` classes.
    2. Mock the `MusicClient` class with `Jest` mock.
    3. Mock a `get` function since the `MusicService` class depends on the it.
    4. Implement the `MusicClient` class with mock `get` function.
    5. Before each test, create a new instance of the `MusicService` class.
    6. In the first test, call the `getFavoriteMusic` method. Then, check if the result of the mock `get` function matches the expected `favoriteMusic`.
    7. In the second test, call the `getFavoriteMusic` method twice. Then, verify that the mock get function is called only once
    8. After each test, ensure to clear the mock functions to maintain a clean testing environment

## Run the test

Run `npm run test -- --testPathPattern=./mock/test` and we should see the following output:

```bash
  MusicService
    √ fetching favorite music (4 ms)
    √ calls get() only once after fetching favorite music (1 ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       2 passed, 2 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        0.553 s, estimated 2
```

## Stub

Stub is a dummy/fake object that can be used in place of an actual object (dependency). Since we control the behavior of the stub, we can use it simplify our tests. Let's take a look at an example.

## Creating a Music Service with Stub

We are going to create a similar Music Service as previous section, but this time, we are going to use a stub instead of a mock.

Create a `stub` folder and inside, create a file `MusicService.js` and `MusicClient.js`

```javascript
class MusicClient {
  async get() {
    const data = await fetch('https://music/myfavorite');
    return await data.json();
  }
}

module.exports = MusicClient;

class MusicService {
  constructor(client) {
    this.client = client;
  }

  async getFavoriteMusic() {
    return await this.client.get();
  }
}

module.exports = MusicService;
```

The `MusicClient` is same as before. The `MusicService` class simply returns favorite music data instead of saving to a property.

## Implementing the test with Stub

Create a `test` folder inside the `stub` folder and create a file `MusicService.test.js` and `MusicClientStub.js`.

```javascript
class MusicClientStub {
  async get() {
    return ['song1', 'song2'];
  }
}

module.exports = MusicClientStub;
```

The `MusicClientStub` dummy class returns a favorite music data instead of making a request to the server.

```javascript
const MusicService = require('../MusicService');
const MusicClientStub = require('./MusicClientStub');

describe('MusicService', () => {
  let musicService;
  beforeEach(() => {
    musicService = new MusicService(new MusicClientStub());
  });
  test('fetching favorite music', async () => {
    const favoriteMusic = await musicService.getFavoriteMusic();

    expect(favoriteMusic).toStrictEqual(['song1', 'song2']);
  });
});
```

Our test with `stub` is much simpler than the test with `mock`. We simply passed a `MusicClientStub` to the `MusicService` constructor and called the `getFavoriteMusic` method.

## Run the test

Run `npm run test -- --testPathPattern=./stub/test` and we should see the following output:

```bash
  MusicService
    √ fetching favorite music (7 ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        2.43 s
```

# Summary

In this post, we've not only learned about why we need to write automated tests but also some of the principles and guidelines that we should keep in mind while writing tests.

We've also used the `Jest testing framework` to write basic tests for our `calculator` project. Specifically, we've explored how to work with `expect` and `Matchers` to validate the results of our tests.

Moreover, we've learned how to use `Mock` and `Stub` to isolate our tests by separating the dependencies. When we want to test the behavior of the dependencies, like how many times the function has been called, `Mock` is a better choice than `Stub`. On the other hand, when we want our dependency to simply return some values, `Stub` is a better choice than Mock.

In the next post, we will learn about how to write tests for a `React` application. We will use `React Testing Library` and `Jest` to write `Unit` and `Integration` tests. Then, we will use `Cypress` to write `End-to-End` tests.
