Another AOC challenge! However, this time, I will be using C language to solve the problem. I just started to learn C, so the code might be a bit messy, but let's dive into it. The challenge can be found in [here] (https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/5)

# Problem Description

<Collapse>
In part1, We are given a list of nearby lines of vents we need to avoid. The lines of vents are listed as a `pair of coordinates` e.g. : "(0,0)->(1,1)". We need to draw a `horizontal or vertiacal lines` from given points to avoid vents. After drawing all the lines, our goal is to find all the points that `overlaps`.

In part2, now instead of drawing only horizontal or vertiacal lines, we can draw `diagonal lines` as well. Then, we need to find the number of points that `overlaps`.

# Solution

## Part 1

In part 1, I started by reading text input and saving the starting and end points of each line in a struct `coordinates`. 

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "lib.h"
#include "ptr_vector.h"

struct Coord {
    int x1;
    int y1; 
    int x2; 
    int y2; 
};

int find_max(int max, int p1, int p2 );
int draw_lines(PointVector *ptr_vector, int max_x, int max_y);
void swap(int *p1, int *p2);
void draw(struct Coord *ptr, int** surface);
int **create_surface(int max_x, int max_y);

int main(void) {
    FILE *file = read_file_data("./inputs/q5.txt");
    char line[100];
    int x1, y1, x2, y2, max_x=0, max_y=0;
    PointVector *ptr_vector = init_ptr_vector(100);

    while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), file) != NULL) {
        if (sscanf_s(line, "%d,%d -> %d,%d", &x1, &y1, &x2, &y2) == 4) {
            struct Coord *coord = (struct Coord *)malloc(sizeof(struct Coord));
            coord -> x1 = x1;
            coord -> y1 = y1;
            coord -> x2 = x2;
            coord -> y2 = y2;
            push(ptr_vector, coord);
            max_x = find_max(max_x, x1, x2);
            max_y = find_max(max_y, y1, y2);
        }
    } 

    draw_lines(ptr_vector, max_x+1, max_y+1);

    free_ptr_vector(ptr_vector);
    fclose(file);
    return 1;
}
```

In the header, I included all the standard and custom library files I will using in the program. `lib.h` simply provides a function to read the file and handle errors. `ptr_vector.h` provides a dynamic array that excepts any type of `pointer`.

Then, I read each line with `fgets` function and parse the string line with `sscanf_s` function to get each x1, y1, x2, y2 coordinates. Afterwards, I allocated memory for `Coord` struct and saved the struct's pointer to a `ptr_vector`. I also kept track of the maximum x and y to create a surface to draw the lines.

Now, I passed the `ptr_vector` and the maximum x and y to `draw_lines` function to initialize the surface and draw the lines of vent. 

```C
int **create_surface(int max_x, int max_y) {
    int i,j;
    int **surface = (int **)malloc(sizeof(int* ) *max_y);
    
    for (i=0; i < max_y; i++) {
        surface[i] = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) *max_x);
    }
    
    for (i=0;i<max_y;i++) {
        for (j=0;j<max_x;j++) {
            surface[i][j] = 0;
        }
    }
    return surface;
}

int draw_lines(PointVector *ptr_vector, int max_x, int max_y) {
    int **surface = create_surface(max_x, max_y);
    int  i,j,overlaps = 0;
    struct Coord *ptr;
    printf("%d %d\n", max_x, max_y);

    for (i=0; i< ptr_vector->size; i++) {
        ptr = ptr_vector->array[i];
        draw(ptr, surface);
    }

    for (i=0;i<max_y;i++) {
        for (j=0;j<max_x;j++) {
            if (surface[i][j]> 1) {
                overlaps +=1;
            }
        }
    }

    printf("overlaps - %d", overlaps);

    for (i=0; i < max_y; i++) {
        free(surface[i]); 
    }
    free(surface);
    return 1;
}
```
The above code runs as follows:
    1. Initialize the surface with `create_surface` function.
    2. The `create_function` allocates memory for the surface with max x and y. Then, I sets all the values to 0.
    3. For each `Coord struct pointer` in the `ptr_vector`, I drew the line with `draw` function.
    4. Finally, I counted the number of points that overlaps and freed the memory.

Now, the `draw` function looks at the start and end points and draws a line on the surface. 

```C
void draw(struct Coord *ptr, int** surface) {
    int x1=ptr->x1;
    int x2=ptr->x2;
    int y1=ptr->y1; 
    int y2=ptr->y2;
    
    if (x1 == x2) {
        if (y1 > y2) {
            swap(&y1,&y2);
        }
        while (y1 <= y2) {
            surface[y1++][x1] += 1;
        }
    } else if (y1 == y2) {
        if (x1 > x2) {
            swap(&x1,&x2);
        }
        while (x1 <= x2) {
            surface[y1][x1++] += 1;
        }
    }
}

void swap(int *p1, int *p2) {
    int temp = *p1;
    *p1 = *p2;
    *p2 = temp;
}
```
For convience, I saved each x and ys to a variable. If the x1 and x2 are the same, I made sure that y1 is always smaller than y2. Then, I drew a line from y1 to y2. Same logic applies when y1 and y2 are the same.

After running the program, I got the following output:

```text
overlaps - 7436
```

## Part 2

Part 2 is same as part 1, except I needed to draw the diagonal lines as well. I modified the `draw` function to draw the diagonal lines when both x and y points are different.

```C
void draw(struct Coord *ptr, int** surface) {
    int x1=ptr->x1, x2=ptr->x2, y1=ptr->y1, y2=ptr->y2;

    if (x1 == x2) {
        if (y1 > y2) {
            swap(&y1,&y2);
        }
        while (y1 <= y2) {
            surface[y1++][x1] += 1;
        }
    } else if (y1 == y2) {
        if (x1 > x2) {
            swap(&x1,&x2);
        }
        while (x1 <= x2) {
            surface[y1][x1++] += 1;
        }
    } else {
        mark_surface(surface, x1, y1, x2, y2);
    }
}
```

To prevent the code from getting too messy, I created a new function `mark_surface` to draw the diagonal lines. The function takes the `surface` and x and y points.

```C
void mark_surface(int** surface, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
    int y_larger = y1 < y2;
    int x_larger = x1 < x2;
    switch (y_larger*10 + x_larger) { 
        case 11:            
            while (x1 <= x2) {
                surface[y1++][x1++] += 1;
            }
            break;
        case 10:            
            while (x1 >= x2) {
                surface[y1++][x1--] += 1;
            }
            break;
        case 0:            
            while (x1 >= x2) {
                surface[y1--][x1--] += 1;
            }
            break;        
        case 1:            
            while (x1 <= x2) {
                surface[y1--][x1++] += 1;
            }
            break;        
        default:
            printf("invalid condition");
            exit(1);
    }
}
```

The `mark_surface` compares the point(x1,y1) to the point(x2,y2). Imagine that the point(x1,y1) is at the center of the cartesian plane. The point(x2,y2) can be in one of the four quadrants. Since `true` return 1 and `false` return 0 in C, I used a switch statement to check the four conditions and draw the diagonal line accordingly.

After running the program, I got the following output:

```text
overlaps - 21104
```

# Summary

Writing a program in C let me appreciate the abstraction that other languages provide regarding syntax, memory management and data structure. For this problem, I had to allocate and deallocate memory for using pointers. I also had to manually create a dynamic array (vector). However, I enjoyed the process since it helped me to get better understanding of how the computer works. In the future posts, I will using C to solve more AOC problems.

I hope you enjoyed this post. If you are interested, you might also have some fun with [AOC 2021 day 5](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/5)
