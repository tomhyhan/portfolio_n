In today's post, I will dive into my solution to AOC 2020 day 12 in Rust. The Challenge can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/22).

# Problem Statement

<Collapse>
Part 1 is relatively simple. We are given two decks of cards and we have to simulate the `Combat` game. The game is played as follows:

    1. Each player draws a card from the top of their deck.
    2. Player with higher card value wins the round.
    3. The winner place both cards at the bottom of their deck.

The game ends when one of the player has no more card left. Then, we calculate the winner's score by adding up the product of the card value and its position in the deck.

Part 2 becomes more complex with additional rules. Now when player draws a card, if the card's value is less than or eqaul to the number of the cards left in the deck, players play a sub-game. The sub-game repeats the same rules as a main game. To prevent infinite recursion, we check if the current deck has been seen before. If so, player 1 (crab) wins the game. The rest of the rules are the same as part 1.

# Solution

## Part 1

To play the game, I am going to create a struct called `Combat` to represent the game.

```rust
struct Combat {
    crab: VecDeque<i32>,
    player: VecDeque<i32>
}

impl Combat {
    fn new() -> Self {
        let content = get_file("src/input/q22.txt").unwrap();
        let (player1, player2) = content.split_once("\r\n\r\n").unwrap();
        let crab = player1.lines().skip(1).map(|num| num.parse::<i32>().unwrap()).collect();
        let player = player2.lines().skip(1).map(|num| num.parse::<i32>().unwrap()).collect();
        Self {crab,player}
    }
}
```
I used a `deque` to represent the deck of cards for both players. Player 1 is a crab and player 2 is a player.

Next, I am going to implement the `play` function to simulate the game.

```rust
    fn play(&mut self) {
         while !self.player.is_empty() && !self.crab.is_empty() {
            let crab_top = self.crab.pop_front().unwrap();
            let player_top = self.player.pop_front().unwrap();

            if player_top > crab_top {
                self.player.push_back(player_top);
                self.player.push_back(crab_top);
            } else {
                self.crab.push_back(crab_top);
                self.crab.push_back(player_top);
            }
        } 
        let cards = if self.player.is_empty() {self.crab.clone()} else {self.player.clone()};
        self.calc_total_score(cards); 
    }
```
The play function above pops the top card from both player's deck. Whoerver has the higher card value wins the round. Both player's cards go at the bottom of the winner's deck. 

When the game ends, I calculated the winner's total score

```rust
    fn calc_total_score(&self, cards: VecDeque<i32>) {
        let mut factor = cards.len() as i32;
        let mut score = 0;
        for card in cards.iter() {
            score += *card * factor;
            factor -= 1
        }
        println!("score - {:?}", score)
    }
```

Iterate through each card and multiply it by its position in the deck.

Running the code will give you the correct answer.

## Part 2

In part 2, I am going to modify the `play` function to add `recursive play` rule to the game.

```rust
    fn play(&mut self) {
        let player = self.player.clone();
        let crab = self.crab.clone();
        let (cards, _) = self.recursive_play(player, crab);
        self.calc_total_score(cards); 
    }
```

Simply make a copy of player's deck, and pass them into a `recursive_play` function.

```rust
    fn recursive_play(&mut self, mut player: VecDeque<i32>, mut crab: VecDeque<i32>) -> (VecDeque<i32>, bool){
        let mut player_inf = HashSet::new();
        let mut crab_inf = HashSet::new();

        while !player.is_empty() && !crab.is_empty() {
            if !player_inf.insert(player.clone()) || !crab_inf.insert(crab.clone()) {
                return (crab,false)
            }
            let crab_top = crab.pop_front().unwrap();
            let player_top = player.pop_front().unwrap();
            let current_winner;
            if crab_top <= crab.len() as i32 && player_top <= player.len() as i32 {
                let new_player = player.make_contiguous().iter().take(player_top as usize).cloned().collect();
                let new_crab = crab.make_contiguous().iter().take(crab_top as usize).cloned().collect();
                let (_, winner) = self.recursive_play(new_player,new_crab);
                current_winner = winner
            } else {
                current_winner = if player_top > crab_top {true} else {false}
            }
            if current_winner {
                player.push_back(player_top);
                player.push_back(crab_top);
            } else {
                crab.push_back(crab_top);
                crab.push_back(player_top);
            }
        } 

        if player.is_empty() {
            (crab, false)
        } else {
            (player, true)
        }
    }
```
Same rules as part 1, but here are the additional rules:

    1. For each player, I created a `HashSet` to store the deck of cards that has been seen before. If the current deck has been seen before, player 1 (crab) wins the game to prevent an `infinite loop`.
    2. If both player's card value is less than or equal to the number of cards left in the deck, create a new deck with the number of cards equal to the card value. Then, play a `sub-game` with the new deck.
    3. Recursively play the game until one of the player has no more card left and return `(winner's deck, winner)`. 

Finally, the `recursive_play` function will return the winner's deck. Then, I calculated the winner's total score to get the final answer.

When running a problem, I got:
```text
score - 36463
part 2 ran in : 1.8135976s
```

# Summary

In today's post, we used recursion to write effective solution. Specifically, we implemented one function to solve `sub-game` without manually implementing each `sub-game`.
