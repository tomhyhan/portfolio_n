In today's post, I will be sharing yet another interesting problem from Advent of Code 2021 - Day 20. I solved this problem using C, like the previous one. Let's walk through the solution.

# Problem Description

<Collapse>

In Part 1, we are given an `image enhancement algorithm` and the input `image`. Our task is to enhance the given image by replacing each pixel using the algorithm. More specifically, each pixel in the `image` grid is represented as either `#` or `.`. We need to examine the adjacent pixels and extract their bit patterns.
```text
#.#
#..
### -> 101100111 -> 359
```
Then, we need to replace the current pixel with the pixel at index `359` of the `algorithm` array. 

One thing to note is that the given `image` is `infinite` in size, meaning that the `image` grid is much larger than the given `image` input. We need to account for every pixel in the `infinite` image grid.

In Part 1, we are asked to perform the image enhancement `twice` and return the number of `#` pixels in the final image.

In Part 2, nothing changes except that we need to perform the image enhancement `50` times.

# Solution 

## Part 1

Let's start by declaring some macro constants. 

```c
#define MARGIN (100)
#define IMAGE (100) /* change this to 5 for sample input */ 
#define IMAGE_SIZE (IMAGE + MARGIN * 2)
#define DECODE_SIZE (512)
```
`MARIN` represents the extra margin size of the `image` grid. The `image` increases its size for every enhancement iteration, and as Part 2 requires 50 iterations, I have set the `margin` to `100` to accommodate the expansion.

`IMAGE` denotes the starting grid size of our input `image`.

`IMAGE_SIZE` encompasses the total size of the `image` grid, including the `margin`.

`DECODE_SIZE` represents the size of the `algorithm` array, as described in the problem statement.

Next, I parse the input text and store the data accordingly.

```c
void parse_input(FILE *file, char decode[], char image[][IMAGE_SIZE])
{
    size_t i = 0, row = MARGIN, col = MARGIN;
    char ch;
    while (fscanf_s(file, "%c", &ch, 1) && ch != '\n')
    {
        if (ch == '.' || ch == '#')
        {
            decode[i++] = ch;
        }
    }

    while (fscanf_s(file, "%c", &ch, 1) != EOF)
    {
        if (ch == '.' || ch == '#')
        {
            image[row][col] = ch;
            col++;
            if (col == IMAGE + MARGIN)
            {
                row++;
                col = MARGIN;
            }
        }
    }
}

void solution(FILE *file)
{
    char decode[DECODE_SIZE] = {0};
    int64_t pixels;
    char image[IMAGE_SIZE][IMAGE_SIZE];
    init_image(image);

    parse_input(file, decode, image);
}
```
The `decode` is a character array with size `DECODE_SIZE`. The `image` is a 2D character array with size `IMAGE_SIZE`. The `image` grid is initialized with `.`.

The `parse_input` function first looks for a `char` until the end of a new line and saves it to the `decode` array when the `char` is `.` or `#`. Then, the function parses the rest of the input in a similar logic and saves it to the `image` grid. Note that the starting row and column of the `image` grid is the `MARGIN`.

After parsing the input, it's time to enhance the `image` grid.

```c
void solution(FILE *file)
{
    // ...
    enhance_image(decode, image, 2);
}

void enhance_image(char decode[], char image[][IMAGE_SIZE], size_t iteration)
{
    size_t i;
    for (i = 1; i <= iteration; i++) {
        size_t row, col;
        size_t l_bound, h_bound;
        char new_image[IMAGE_SIZE][IMAGE_SIZE];
        init_image(new_image);
        l_bound = MARGIN - i ;
        h_bound = MARGIN + IMAGE + i - 1 ;
        for (row = l_bound; row <= h_bound; row++) {
            for (col = l_bound; col <= h_bound; col++) {
                size_t idx = generate_decode_idx(row, col, image, l_bound, h_bound, i % 2 == 0);
                new_image[row][col] = decode[idx];
            }
        }
        copy_image(image, new_image);
    }
}
```
The `enhance_image` function takes the `decode` array, the `image` grid, and the number of `iterations` as input.

For each iteration, a new `image` grid is created and initialized with `.`. This `new_image` grid will be used to store the current enhanced image.

Then, the lower and higher bounds of the `image` grid are calculated, extending one level larger than the current `image` grid.

Next, the code iterates through the `image` grid, examining each pixel to generate the corresponding `decode` index.
```c
size_t generate_decode_idx(size_t row, size_t col, char image[][IMAGE_SIZE], size_t l_bound, size_t h_bound, bool is_odd)
{
    int32_t i, j;
    size_t idx = 0;
    
    for (i = -1; i < 2; i++)
    {
        for (j = -1; j < 2; j++)
        {
            size_t nr = row + i, nc = col + j;

            if (is_odd && (nr <= l_bound || nr >= h_bound || nc <= l_bound || nc >= h_bound)) {
                idx = idx << 1 | 1;
                continue;
            }

            if (image[nr][nc] == '#') {
                idx = idx << 1 | 1;
            } else {
                idx = idx << 1 | 0;
            }
        }
    }
    assert(idx >= 0 && idx < 512);
    return idx;
}
```
The `generate_decode_idx` function takes the current `row`, `col`, `image` grid, the `lower` and `higher` bounds, and a boolean flag `is_odd`.

The `is_odd` flag is used to determine whether the current iteration is odd or even. With the sample input, there is no need to worry about the `is_odd` flag since the `decode` array at index `0` is `.`. However, in our actual input, the `decode` array at index `0` is `#`. In other words, during odd iterations, every pixel outside of the current `image` boundary will be treated as `#`.

```text
...    ###
... -> ###
...    ###
```
Continuing with the `generate_decode_idx` function, the `idx` variable is initialized with the value 0, and it iterates through the adjacent pixels. If the current iteration is odd, and the adjacent pixel is outside of the current `image` boundary, the adjacent pixel is `#`.

To determine the index: if the adjacent pixel is `#`, the function shifts the `idx` to the left by `1` and adds `1` to it. Otherwise, it adds `0` to it.

After generating the `idx`, the `enhance_image` function replaces the pixel in the `new_image` grid with the corresponding pixel in the `decode` array.

Finally, the `copy_image` function copies the contents of the `new_image` grid to the `image` grid.

```c
void copy_image(char image_dest[][IMAGE_SIZE], char image_src[][IMAGE_SIZE]) {
    size_t i;
    for (i=0; i < IMAGE_SIZE; i ++) {
        memcpy(image_dest[i], image_src[i], sizeof(image_dest[i]));
    }
}
```
To find the number of `#` pixels in the final image, I simply iterate through the `image` grid and count the number of `#` pixels.

```c
int64_t lit_pixels(char image[][IMAGE_SIZE]) {
    int64_t pixels = 0;
    size_t i,j;
    for (i = 0; i < IMAGE_SIZE; i++)
    {
        for (j = 0; j < IMAGE_SIZE; j++)
        {
            if (image[i][j] == '#') {
                pixels++;
            }
        }
    }
    return pixels;
}

void solution(FILE *file)
{
    // ...
    pixels = lit_pixels(image);
    printf("pixels: %lld\n", pixels);
}
```

# Part 2

Part 2 is the same as Part 1, except that the number of iterations needs to be changed to `50` instead of `2`.

```c
void solution(FILE *file)
{
    // ...
    enhance_image(decode, image, 50);
}
```

# Summary

In today's post, I learned about the simpler form of the `image enhancement algorithm`. A real-world example of an image processing algorithm can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)). I also found that bit shifting was very useful for generating an index. It is fast and the code is easy to understand.
