In this solution, I will be going through my solution to the Advent of Code 2019 day 6 challenge in Rust. The challenge can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/6).

# Part 1

We are given an input that looks like this:

```text
   COM)B
    B)C
    C)D
    D)E
    E)F
    B)G
    G)H
    D)I
    E)J
    J)K
    K)L
```

<Note>this is a sample input, the actual input is much larger</Note>

The input is a list of orbits, where each orbit is a pair of objects. The first object is in orbit around the second object. The second object is orbitting around the first object.

We are asked to count the total number of direct and indirect orbits in the input. In the sample input above, there are 42 direct and indirect orbits.

visually it looks like this:

```text
        G - H       J - K - L
       /           /
COM - B - C - D - E - F
               \
                I
```

There are many ways to solve this problem, but my first approach would be a `direct graph` + `depth first search` to count all the direct and indirect orbits.

First, we need to parse the input into a graph. We can do this by iterating over each line in the input, and spliting the line by the `)` character. Then we can add the first object as a key, and the second object as a value in the graph. We can use a `HashMap` to store the graph and create an adjacency list. I used `num_of_orbits` is to keep track of total direct and indirect orbits.

```rust
struct Map {
    orbits: HashMap<String, Vec<String>>
}

impl Map {
    fn new() -> Self {
        let content = get_file("src/input/q6.txt").unwrap();
        let orbits = content.lines().fold(HashMap::new(), |mut acc, orbit| {
            let (parent,child) = orbit.split_once(')').unwrap();
            acc.entry(parent.to_string()).or_insert(vec![]).push(child.to_string());
            acc
        });
        let num_of_orbits = 0;
        Self {orbits, num_of_orbits}
    }
}
```

Now, we can use a `depth first search` to count the number of direct and indirect orbits. We start at the root node (COM), and recursively traverse the graph. We can keep track of the depth of the current node, and add it to the total number of orbits.

```rust
    fn count_orbits(&mut self, start: String) {
        println!("{:?}", Map::dfs(&start, 0, &self.orbits));
    }

    fn dfs(orbit:&String, depth: usize, orbits: &HashMap<String, Vec<String>>) -> usize{
        if !orbits.contains_key(orbit) {
            return depth
        }
        let mut num_of_orbits = depth;

        for child_orbit in orbits.get(orbit).unwrap()  {
            num_of_orbits += Map::dfs(&child_orbit, depth + 1, orbits);
        }
        num_of_orbits
    }
```

<Note>
  dfs function does not take self as a parameter to simplify the code.
  Otherwise, rust's borrow checker will complain about multiple mutable borrows.
</Note>

# Part 2

In part 2, we are asked to find the minimum number of orbital transfers required to move from the object YOU are orbiting to the object SAN is orbiting.

```text
                          YOU
                         /
        G - H       J - K - L
       /           /
COM - B - C - D - E - F
               \
                I - SAN
```

In the sample input above, the minimum number of orbital transfers required is 4.

My first intuition was to keep records of parents of each child node which allow us to backtrack from the child node to the parent node.

Then, we can split our problem into 3 steps.

First, we find the distance between the root node to YOU and SAN by modifying our dfs function to dfs_to_target.

Second, we balance the distance of YOU and SAN by backtracking from the node with the longer distance to the node with the shorter distance. In the example above, we backtrack from YOU to COM 2 times.

Lastly, we move up a graph until we find the lowest common ancestor of YOU and SAN. In the example above, we move up from J and SAN until we find the lowest common ancestor.

```rust
    fn min_traverse_distance(&self, start:String) {
        let you = Map::dfs_to_target(&start, 0, &self.orbits, &"YOU".to_string());
        let san = Map::dfs_to_target(&start, 0, &self.orbits, &"SAN".to_string());

        let mut distance = 0;
        distance += (you as i32 - san as i32).abs() as usize;

        let (mut current, target, target_depth,mut seek_depth) = if san > you {
            ("SAN".to_string(),"YOU".to_string(),you, san)
        } else {
            ("YOU".to_string(),"SAN".to_string(),san, you)
        };

        while target_depth != seek_depth {
            current = self.find_parent(&mut current);
            seek_depth -= 1;
        }

        let mut target_parent = self.parents.get(&target).unwrap();
        let mut current_parent = self.parents.get(&current).unwrap();
        while target_parent != current_parent {
            target_parent = self.parents.get(target_parent).unwrap();
            current_parent = self.parents.get(current_parent).unwrap();
            distance += 2;
        }

        println!("{:?}", distance);
    }

    fn find_parent(&self, current: &mut String) -> String {
        self.parents.get(current).unwrap().clone()
    }

    fn dfs_to_target(orbit:&String, depth: usize, orbits: &HashMap<String, Vec<String>>, target: &String) -> usize {
        if orbit == target {
            return depth
        }
        if !orbits.contains_key(orbit) {
            return 0
        }

        let mut num_of_orbits = 0;
        for child_orbit in orbits.get(orbit).unwrap()  {
            num_of_orbits += Map::dfs_to_target(&child_orbit, depth + 1, orbits, target);
        }
        num_of_orbits
    }
```

<Information>
  we can further optimize by refactoring the code by spilting our
  min_traverse_distance() function. it will give us better readability and
  testability.

When we run a program, we get:

```text
    227612
    part1 ran in : 6.2466ms
    454
    part2 ran in : 7.6002ms
```

Wow, that's pretty fast! I am pretty sure I can optimize the code further, but I am happy with the result.

Today's problem was more algorithmic than usual AOC problems, but I enjoyed it a lot. If you are interested, you might also have some fun with [this](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/6) problem.
