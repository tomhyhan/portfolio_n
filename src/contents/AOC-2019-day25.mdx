In this post, I will be solving the AOC 2019 day 19 in Rust. I have created a mini-adventure game to solve the problem. The game is created using Rust lambda function for you to play. The challenge can be found in [here](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/25).

# Text-adventure Game

<Adventure></Adventure>

<Information>
Instructions:

north : Go up\
south : Go down\
east  : Go right\
west  : Go left\
take \<ITEM\> : Take the item\
drop \<ITEM\> : Drop the item\
inv : Check the inventory

**The limit is 3000 requests per day

# Problem Description
<Collapse>
For this problem, we only have part 1 since it is the last question of the year 2019. Also, it requires a prerequisite of int-code machine that I created from previous challages, since we need to use the int-code machine to explore the maze.

The problem is a text adventure game where we need to collect all the items in the game and drop them in the `pressure-sensitive` floor to escape. The items are scattered around the rooms so we need to input the commands to explore the maze. All the commands are listed with the above mini-adventure game.

# Solution

## Part1
The first thing I did is to create a `game` just like our mini-adventure game to accept the input and output the result. I manually input the commands to explore the maze and collect all the items. 

Then, I created function that take items and produce every combination of the items.

```rust
fn generate_powerset(items: Vec<&str>) -> Vec<Vec<String>> {
    let mut sets = vec![vec![]];
    for item in items.iter() {
        let len = sets.len();
        for i in 0..len {
            let mut new_set = sets[i].clone();
            new_set.push(item.to_string());
            sets.push(new_set);
        }
    }
    sets
}
```

After that, I tried every combination of the items to enter the `pressure-sensitive` floor. 

```rust
fn add_command_to_program(program: &mut ProgramASCII, command:&str, item: &str) {
    let s  = format!("{}{}",command, item);
    let mut str_chars:VecDeque<char> = s.trim_end().chars().collect();
    str_chars.push_back('\n');
    program.str_chars.extend(str_chars);
}

fn part1(&mut self) {
    let mut program_acsii = ProgramASCII::new("north\ntake sand\nnorth\nnorth\ntake astrolabe\nsouth\nsouth\nwest\nwest\ntake mutex\neast\neast\nsouth\neast\ntake klein bottle\neast\ntake semiconductor\nwest\nnorth\nnorth\nnorth\ntake dehydrated water\nsouth\nsouth\nsouth\nwest\nwest\nnorth\ntake shell\nsouth\nsouth\nwest\ntake ornament\nwest\nsouth\n".to_string());
    
    // manually found items in the game
    let items = vec!["mutex", "ornament", "sand", "astrolabe", "klein bottle", "semiconductor", "dehydrated water", "shell"];

    for item in items.iter() {
        add_command_to_program(&mut program_acsii, "drop ", item)
    }
    
    let command_sets = generate_powerset(items);
    for commands in command_sets.iter() {
        for command in commands.iter() {
            add_command_to_program(&mut program_acsii, "take ", command)
        }    
        add_command_to_program(&mut program_acsii, "", "south");
        for command in commands.iter() {
            add_command_to_program(&mut program_acsii, "drop ", command)
        }  
    }

    let mut msg = "".to_string();
    while let Some(output) = program_acsii.run_program(0) {
        let c = output as u8 as char;
        if c == '\n' {
            if !msg.is_empty() {
                println!("{:?}", msg);
            } 
            msg.clear()
        } else {
            msg.push(c);
        }
    }
}
```
I used `add_command_to_program` function to add commands to the program. I applied deque to store the commands so that the int-code machine can read the commands LILO (Last In Last Out) order.

Then, I input commands for droping all the items and trying different combinations of the items.

When I ran the program, I got the following output. 

```text
"== Pressure-Sensitive Floor =="
"Analyzing..."
"Doors here lead:"
"- north"
"A loud, robotic voice says \"Analysis complete! You may proceed.\" and you enter the cockpit."
"Santa notices your small droid, looks puzzled for a moment, realizes what has happened, and radios your ship directly."
"\"Oh, hello! You should be able to get in by typing 134807554 on the keypad at the main airlock.\""
```

# Summary

In today's challage, I was able to build a mini-adventure game using Rust backend. It was my first time trying out Rust lambda function, and it was fun to play with it. However, I felt like it was not the best way to create a lambda function, since it took long time to compile and caused some errors when I tried to change, save and run the function again. I think it is better to create a lambda function using Node.js or Python rather than custom script.

In any case, the problem itself was very creative and fun to solve. I enjoyed playing the game and solving the problem. If you are interested, you might also have some fun with [AOC 2019 day 25](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/25).
