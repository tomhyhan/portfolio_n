In this post, I am going to walk through the steps of how I built a Tic Tac Toe AI using the minimax algorithm. Let's dive right in!

# Final result

# Set up

We are going to use Next.js to build the game since it is easy to set up and deploy later on.

Start by creating a new Nextjs project:

```bash
npx create-next-app tic-tac-toe-ai
```

# Creating a board (main) page

Inside a root `Page.tsx` file, we are going to create `board` and `turn` states and render them according to the game logic.

```javascript
"use client";

import { useState } from "react"
import Block from "./component/block";
import { draws, nextBestMove, wins } from './lib/utils';

export default function Home() {
    const [board, setBoard] = useState(Array(9).fill(null))
    const [turn, setTurn] = useState("computer")
    const win = wins(board) 
    const draw = draws(board) 
    const end = win || draw

    const handleBlockClick = (coord: number) => {
        if (board[coord] !== null || end) return;
        
        const newBoard = [...board]
        newBoard[coord] = "X"
        setTurn("computer")
        setBoard(newBoard)
    }

    if (turn == "computer") {
        const newBoard = [...board]
        const bestMove = nextBestMove(newBoard)
        if (bestMove !== null) newBoard[bestMove] = "O"; 
        setTurn("human")
        setBoard(newBoard)
    }
    

    
  return (
    <>
        {win && <div>{turn === "human"? "You Lost" : "You Won"}</div>}
        {draw && <div>Draw<br /></div>}
        <main >
            <div className="grid grid-cols-3 w-3/4">
                {board.map((val, coord) => <Block key={coord} val={val} coord={coord} onBlockClick={handleBlockClick}/>)}
            </div>
        </main>
        {end && <button onClick={()=>{setBoard(Array(9).fill(null));setTurn("computer")}} className="border-2 p-2 rounded m-2">retry</button>}
    </>
    )
}

```
Let's start by importing the `draws`, `nextBestMove`, and `wins` functions from the `utils.ts` file. I will be explaining these functions shortly.

The `Home` component will initialize the `board` with all `null` values and begin the game with the `computer`'s turn.

If the current turn belongs to the `computer`, it will evaluate the `next best move` and update the `board` with `O`. Then, it will pass the turn to the `human` player.

Next, the `human` player can make a move by clicking on the `Block` component. If the `Block` is already occupied or the game is over, it will do nothing and return. Otherwise, it will update the `board` with `X` and pass the turn back to the `computer`.

Finally, the current state of the `board` will be shown to the player. If the game is over, it will display the `result` and a `retry` button to restart the game."

# Creating a Block component

Create a `component` file, and create a `Block.tsx` file inside.

The `Block` component is simple:

```javascript 
import React from 'react'

export default function Block({val, coord, onBlockClick}: {
    val: string | null,
    coord: number,
    onBlockClick(coord:number): void
}) {

  return (
    <button onClick={()=>onBlockClick(coord)}className="border-2 h-24 text-7xl font-extralight	">{val}</button>
  )
}
```
The `Block` component will receive the block's value, coordinates, and a callback function to handle the click event. It will then return a simple button with the value of the block.

# Creating a utils file

Create a `lib` folder and create a `utils.ts` file inside.

The `utils` file will have bunch of functions for a `computer` to evaluate the `next best move`. Let's go through them one by one.

## `wins` function

The tic tac toe game ends when one player successfully places three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row.

```javascript
export function wins(board: (string | null)[]) {
    for (let row=0; row<3; row++ ) {
        if (matches(board[row*3+0],board[row*3+1],board[row*3+2])) {
            return true
        }
    }

    for (let col=0; col<3; col++ ) {
        if (matches(board[0*3+col],board[1*3+col],board[2*3+col])) {
            return true
        }
    }

    if (matches(board[0], board[4], board[8])) return true;
    if (matches(board[2], board[4], board[6])) return true;

    return false
}

function matches(b1:(string | null),b2:(string | null),b3:(string | null)){
    if (b1 != null && b1 == b2 && b2 == b3 ) {
        return true
    }
    return false
}
```
The `wins` function takes in the current board as input. It then checks the `win` condition horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If a win is found, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

## `draws` function

The `draw` function is simply. when both players have marked every block on the board and there is no winner, it results in a `draw`.

```javascript
export function draws(board: (string | null)[]) {
    for (let i=0; i<board.length; i++) {
        if (board[i] === null) {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}
```
The `draw` function takes the current board as input. Then, it checks for any `null` values in the board. If any are found, it returns `false`; otherwise, it returns `true`.

## `minimax` function

The `minimax` algorithm is called minimax because while one player wants to maximize their outcome, the other player wants to minimize theirs. For example, in the Tic Tac Toe game, `you` want to make the `best possible move` (maximizing) to increase your chances of winning the game. However, your opponent wants to make the `worst possible move` (minimizing) for you to decrease your chances of winning, in turn, maximizing their chance of winning the game.

```javascript
function minimax(board: (string | null)[], aiTurn: boolean) {

    if (wins(board)) {
        return aiTurn? -1: 1
    }

    if (draws(board)) {
        return 0
    }

    if (aiTurn) {
        let maxScore = -Infinity
        for (let i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            if (board[i] !== null) continue;
            board[i] = "O"
            const score = minimax(board, false)
            board[i] = null
            maxScore = Math.max(maxScore, score)
        }
        return maxScore
    } else {
        let minScore = Infinity
        for (let i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            if (board[i] !== null) continue;
            board[i] = "X"
            const score = minimax(board, true)
            board[i] = null
            minScore = Math.min(minScore, score)
        }
        return minScore
    }
}
```
The `minimax` algorithm can be implemented using recursion since the algorithm operates on a tree data structure. The function takes the current `board` and a boolean value `aiTurn` as inputs.

The function tries to maximize the outcome for the `computer`. Thus, it returns `1` if the `computer` wins, `-1` if the `human` wins, and `0` if it's a draw. However, it's important to note that the function actually returns `-1` when `aiTurn` is true. This is because the function checks the `win` condition at the start, which means the `win` condition is evaluated for the previous turn.

Next, I'd like to maximize the score for the `computer`. Therefore, if `aiTurn` is true, the function iterate through the board and check if the current block is `null`. If it is empty (meaning `null`), the function changes the block value to `O` (representing the computer) and recursively calls the `minimax` function. The `minimax` function returns a score, and it resets the block back to `null` for subsequent iterations. The returned `score` is then compared with `maxScore`, and if the `score` is greater than `maxScore`, the function update `maxScore` accordingly. Finally, it returns the `maxScore`.

The similar process will occur when `aiTurn` is false. However, this time, the function will minimize the score for the `human` player â€” that is, it will choose the score where the `human` player wins

## `nextBestMove` Function

The `nextBestMove` function will use all the functions I have created so far to determine the next best move for the `computer`.

```javascript
export function nextBestMove(board: (string | null)[]) {
    let bestMove;
    let bestScore = -Infinity
    for (let i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
        if (board[i] !== null) continue;
        board[i] = "O"
        const score = minimax(board, false)
        board[i] = null
        if (score > bestScore) {
            bestScore = score
            bestMove = i
        }
    }
    if (bestMove == null) return null
    return bestMove
}
```
The `nextBestMove` function will take in the current `board`. It will then iterate through the board and check if the current block is not `null`. if it is `empty` (it is `null`), the function changes the value to `O` (representing the computer value) and runs the `minimax` function. If the returned score is greater than the `bestScore`, it updates the `bestScore` and `bestMove`. Finally, it returns the `bestMove` if the `bestMove` is not `null`; otherwise, it returns `null`.

# Summary

And that's it! I have demonstrated how to build a Tic Tac Toe AI with relatively simple and short code. However, this is just a starting point to get a sense of how the minimax algorithm works. With a solid understanding of the minimax algorithm, we could start building more complex AIs, like a chess AI.
