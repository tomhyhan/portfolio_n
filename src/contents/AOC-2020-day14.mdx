In today's AOC challenge, I will be walking through my solution to AOC 2020 day 14 in Rust. The problem can be found in [here](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/14).

# Problem Description
<Collapse>
In part 1, we are given a list of instructions to run the program on the ferry. The instructions are either a `memory address and value` or a `mask`. The mask is a string of 36 bits, where each bit is either 0, 1, or X. We are asked to apply the `mask` to the `memory value` before it is written to the `memory address`. To apply the mask, 0 and 1 overwrite the corresponding bit in the value, while X leaves the bit in the value unchanged. To get an asnwer, we need to sum all the values in the memory.

In part 2, we are asked to apply the `mask` to the `memory address` instead of the `memory value`. Now, `mask` bit 0 means the corresponding bit is unchanged, 1 means the corresponding bit is overwritten with 1, and X means the corresponding memory bit can either be 0 and 1. Like wise, we need to sum all the values in the memory.

# Solution

## Part1

Since we are dealing with binary numbers, I am going to use bitwise operators in Rust to solve this problem.

First thing first, we need to parse our input.

```rust
struct PortSystem {
    memory: HashMap<u64, u64>,
    instructions: Vec<String>
}

impl PortSystem {
    fn new() -> Self {
        let content = get_file("src/input/q14.txt").unwrap();
        let memory = HashMap::new();
        let instructions = content.lines().map(String::from).collect();
        Self {memory, instructions }
    }
}
```

I created a new PortSystem struct to hold the memory and instructions. I used a HashMap to store the memory address and key in the future. `isntructions` is a vector of string that holds the each line from our `input`.

Then, I am going to create a function to iterate through the instructions and apply the mask to the memory value.

```rust
fn sum_masked_values(&mut self) {
    let mut mask: Option<String> = None;
    for ins in self.instructions.iter() {
        let (key,value) = ins.split_once(" = ").unwrap();
        match key {
            "mask" => {
                mask = Some(value.to_string())
            }
            _ => {
                if let Some(cmask) = mask.clone() {
                    lazy_static! {
                        static ref RE: Regex = Regex::new(r"\d+").unwrap(); 
                    }
                    let location = RE.find(key).unwrap().as_str().parse::<u64>().unwrap();
                    let mask_unchange = cmask.replace("X", "0");
                    let binary = u64::from_str_radix(&mask_unchange, 2).unwrap();
                    let val = value.parse::<u64>().unwrap();
                    let m = binary | val;
                    let mask_change = cmask.replace("X", "1");
                    let binary = u64::from_str_radix(&mask_change, 2).unwrap();
                    self.memory.insert(location, binary & m);
                } else {
                    panic!("mask does not exist")
                }
            }
        }
    }
    println!("sum - {:?}", self.memory.values().sum::<u64>())
}
```

Here is what's going with the code above:

1. Inititalized the mask to None
2. Iterate through the instructions
3. If the current instruction is a `mask`, then set the mask to the current value
4. If the current instruction is a `memory address and value`, then apply the `mask` to the value and insert it into the memory address

To apply the `mask` to the `memory value`, I first replaced the `X` in the mask to `0`. Then, I converted the `mask` to binary using `u64::from_str_radix` method. The binary is now applied to the value using a `| (bitwise OR)` operator. This way, we can preserve all the `1`s in the value and mask. Next, following the same steps, I replaced the `X` in the mask to `1` and applied it to the previous computed value using a `& (bitwise AND)` operator. if the `mask` is `0`, we change the corresponding bit to `0`. Otherwise, we keep the bit unchanged.

To give you an idea of how the mask is applied to the value, here is an example:

```text
address = 0
value = 010
mask = 10X

OR = 010 | 100 = 110
AND = 110(OR) & 101 = 100
finally value, 100 is inserted into the memory address 0 
```

I ran the program, and got the correct answer.

```

## Part2

In the 2, since the behavior of mask values changed, I am going to create a new function to handle the new mask behavior. 

```rust
fn decode_address(&mut self) {
    let mut mask: Option<String> = None;
    for ins in self.instructions.iter() {
        let (key,value) = ins.split_once(" = ").unwrap();
        match key {
            "mask" => {
                mask = Some(value.to_string())
            }
            _ => {
                if let Some(cmask) = mask.clone() {
                    lazy_static! {
                        static ref RE: Regex = Regex::new(r"\d+").unwrap(); 
                    }
                    let value = value.parse::<u64>().unwrap();
                    let address = RE.find(key).unwrap().as_str().parse::<u64>().unwrap();
                    let mut addresses = vec![];
                    self.change_address(address,cmask.chars().collect(), &mut addresses, 0, 0 );
                    for address in addresses.iter() {
                        self.memory.insert(*address, value);
                    }
                } else {
                    panic!("mask does not exist")
                }
            }
        }
    }
    println!("sum - {:?}", self.memory.values().sum::<u64>())
}
```

The `decode_address` function is similar to the `sum_masked_values` function. The only difference is that we are now applying the mask to the memory address instead of the memory value. Because the address can be diverged into multiple addresses, I created a new vector to hold all the addresses and insert the value into each address. 

Next, I created a new function called `change_address` to generate multiple addresses.

```rust
fn change_address(&self, address: u64, mask: Vec<char>, addresses: &mut Vec<u64>, idx: usize, addr_so_far: u64) {
    if let Some(c_mask) = mask.last() {
        match c_mask {
            '0' => {
                self.change_address(address, mask[..mask.len()-1].to_vec(), addresses, idx + 1, addr_so_far + (address & (1 << idx)))
            }
            '1' => {
                self.change_address(address, mask[..mask.len()-1].to_vec(), addresses, idx + 1, addr_so_far + (1 << idx))
            }
            'X' => {
                self.change_address(address, mask[..mask.len()-1].to_vec(), addresses, idx + 1, addr_so_far + (0 << idx));
                self.change_address(address, mask[..mask.len()-1].to_vec(), addresses, idx + 1, addr_so_far + (1 << idx));
            }
            _ => unreachable!()
        }
    } else {
        addresses.push(addr_so_far)
    }
}
```

The `change address` function does the followings:

    1. Take the last character from the mask. If the mask is empty, then push the `addr_so_far` to the `addresses` vector and return nothing.
    2. If the current mask bit (the last character) is 0, I applied the current mask bit to the address' corresponding bit using a `& (bitwise AND)` operator becuase we want to keep the bit unchanged. 
    3. If the current mask bit is 1, we don't worry about the corresponding address bit. So I set the corresponding address bit set to 1. 
    4. If the current mask bit is X, then we need to generate two addresses. One with the corresponding address bit set to 0 and the other with the corresponding address bit set to 1.
    5. After step 2,3 and 4, I added the resulting value to the `addr_so_far` and recursively called the `change_address` function with the updated `addr_so_far`, the mask without the last character and index + 1.

I tested the program and got the correct answer.

# Summary

In today's AOC challenge, we learned how to use bitwise operators in Rust to effectively solve the problem. We also used recursion in a nice and clean way to generate multiple addresses for part 2. Using recursion at right time can make your code more readable then using a loop.
