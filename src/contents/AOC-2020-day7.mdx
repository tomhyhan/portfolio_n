Another AOC problem! In this post, I will be diving into my solution to AOC 2020 day7 in Rust. The challage can be found in [here](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/7).

# Problem Description
<Collapse>
In Part1, we are given a list of rules that describe the bags and their contents for the luggage processing system. We are asked to count the number of bag colors that can eventually contain at least one shiny gold bag. If we have 3 bags where `red bag` contains `blug bag` and `blug bag` contains `shiny gold bag`, then `red bag` can contain `shiny gold bag` and `blug bag` can contain `shiny gold bag`. So the answer is 2.

In Part2, we are asked to find the number of individual bags that are required inside our single `shiny gold bag`. Let's say we have 3 bags where `shiny gold bag` contains `2 red bag` and `red bag` contains `2 blue bag`. Then, inside our `shiny gold bag`, we have `2 red bag` and `4 blue bag` (each red bag contains 2 blug bags). So the answer is 6.

# Input
<Collapse>
#### > Sample Part1 Input

```text
light red bags contain 1 bright white bag, 2 muted yellow bags.
dark orange bags contain 3 bright white bags, 4 muted yellow bags.
bright white bags contain 1 shiny gold bag.
muted yellow bags contain 2 shiny gold bags, 9 faded blue bags.
shiny gold bags contain 1 dark olive bag, 2 vibrant plum bags.
dark olive bags contain 3 faded blue bags, 4 dotted black bags.
vibrant plum bags contain 5 faded blue bags, 6 dotted black bags.
faded blue bags contain no other bags.
dotted black bags contain no other bags.
```

#### > Sample Part2 Input
```text
shiny gold bags contain 2 dark red bags.
dark red bags contain 2 dark orange bags.
dark orange bags contain 2 dark yellow bags.
dark yellow bags contain 2 dark green bags.
dark green bags contain 2 dark blue bags.
dark blue bags contain 2 dark violet bags.
dark violet bags contain no other bags.
```

# Solution

## Part1
If we look at our rules (input), we can see that the bags are in a tree-like structure. So the first thing I am going to do is to parse out our input, and store them in a a `HashMap`.

```rust
struct Regulations {
    rules: HashMap<String, Vec<(String, usize)>>,
    bag_list: Vec<String>
}

impl Regulations {
    fn new() -> Self {
        let content = get_file("src/input/q8.txt").unwrap();
        let mut rules = HashMap::new();
        let mut bag_list = Vec::new();
        content.lines().for_each(|line| {
            let (bag, inside_bags) = line.split_once(" contain ").unwrap();
            let bags;
            if inside_bags.contains("no other bags") {
                bags = vec![];
            } else {
                bags = inside_bags.split(", ").map(|bag_info|{
                    let (num_of_bags, current_bag) = bag_info.split_once(" ").unwrap();
                    (current_bag.trim_end_matches(|c| c== 's'|| c=='.').to_string(), num_of_bags.parse::<usize>().unwrap())
                }).collect();

            }
            rules.insert(bag.trim_end_matches('s').to_string(), bags);
            bag_list.push(bag.trim_end_matches('s').to_string());
        });
        Self { rules, bag_list }
    }
}
```
<Information>
    We could also use `Regex` to simplfy our parsing process
</Information>

I created a struct called `Regulations` to store our rules and the list of bags. The `rules` is a `HashMap` where the key is the bag name and the value is a vector of tuples where the first element is the bag name and the second element is the number of bags. The `bag_list` is a vector of bag names.

Next, I am going to iterate through the `bag_list` and recursively find the number of bags that can contain `shiny gold bag`.

```rust
fn find_how_many_bags_contains(&self, target_bag: String) -> usize{
    self.bag_list.iter().filter(|bag| self.contains(bag, &target_bag)).count()
}

fn contains(&self, bag: &String, target_bag: &String)-> bool {
    let mut is_contain = false;
    for inner_bag_info in self.rules.get(bag).unwrap() {
        let inner_bag = &inner_bag_info.0;
        if inner_bag == target_bag {
            return true
        };
        if self.contains(inner_bag, target_bag) {
            is_contain = true
        }
    }
    is_contain
}
```
The `contains` function will recursively check if the current bag contains the `shiny gold bag` or any bag that contains the `shiny gold bag`.

When I ran the code, I got the correct answer for part1. Now, let's move on to part2.

```text
found - 177
part1 ran in : 75.0312ms
```

## Part2

Part2 could be a bit confusing since each bag contains inner other bags, and each of those inner bags could contain other inner bags. So we need to account for all the outter bags and inner bags like in my description for part2 above.

I felt that this problem is a perfect candidate for recursion. So I will use the recursion function again to find our how many bags are inside our `shiny gold bag`.

```rust
fn cnt_how_many_bags_contains(&self, bag: &String) -> usize{
    let mut cnt = 0;
    for (inner_bag, bag_cnt) in self.rules.get(bag).unwrap() {
        cnt += bag_cnt + bag_cnt * self.cnt_how_many_bags_contains(inner_bag);
    }
    cnt  
}
```
The base case is when the bag contains no inner bags, so it will return 0. Otherwise, the function will go all the way down and return the number of inner bags. Then it will go up one level and multiply the number of bags in that level plus current number of bags. It will keep doing this until it reaches the top level. 

From our Sample description for part 2, the function will show the following result:

```text
dark violet bags will return 0
dark blue bags will return 2 (2 + 2 * 0)
the dark green bags will return 6 (2 + 2 * 2)
dark yellow bags will return 14 (2 + 2 * 6)  
dark orange bags will return 30 (2 + 2 * 14)
dark red bags 62 (2 + 2 * 30)
Finally, shiny gold bags 126 (2 + 2 * 62)
```

I ran the program and got the correct answer for part2.

```text
total - 34988
part2 ran in : 3.3939ms
```

# Summary

Today, AOC problem showed a clean example of using recursion to solve a problem. The code is short, clean and easy to understand. I personally find recursion quiet difficult to understand and use, but this problem was enjoyable to solve. 

I hope you enjoyed it as well. If you are interested, you might also have some fun with [AOC 2020 day 7](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/7)
